                        Research suggests that 25-30 grams of protein per meal can help us feel more full. Protein rich meals can make us feel fuller despite us eating less, which helps to promote better weight management. Healthier weight leads to improvements in risk factors for heart problems such as high triglyceride levels and high blood pressure. A food rich in protein, chicken can help with weight management and reduce the risk of heart disease. <br>

                    <p>Eating salads is a super-convenient way to work in a couple of servings of vegetables and/or fruit. Green salads are on the menu of almost every restaurant. You can even buy a side salad (with Romaine lettuce, carrots and tomatoes, available with fat-free or reduced-calorie salad dressing) for a buck at many fast food chains these days. And you can make a green salad at home in 5 minutes, armed with a bag of pre-washed salad greens, a few carrots or other veggies, and a bottle of light salad dressing. <br>
                        Not only that, but salads are cool, crunchy, and fun to eat (lots of textures, colors, and flavors). Most people enjoy eating salads--even kids! You can customize them to include the fruits and vegetables that appeal to you the most, and whichever ones you have on hand. <br> 
                        It's hard to believe that something we can't even digest can be so good for us! Eating a high-fiber diet can help lower cholesterol levels and prevent constipation.

                    <p>It is important to eat the proper foods before and after a workout. First, eating prior to exercising fuels the body to power through the workout, and second, post-workout eating aids in recovery of muscles. <br>
                        Refueling after exercise gives your body what it needs to recover from the exertion and build bigger, stronger muscles. That means being thoughtful about what you eat before and after exercising will help you maximize the benefits of all your hard work at the gym. There is a huge difference between eating real foods versus just taking supplements. It is suggested to  reach for the types of healthy foods that one already enjoys. <br>
                        Prior to exercising one shouldn’t indulge in a huge meal, but rather just a snack or mini meal  enough to keep dizziness, nausea or lethargy at bay. Dry fruits are among the list of “good carbs”. For a quick, easy and good pre-workout food, fix yourself some dried berries, apricots, figs, and pineapple. Dry fruits are a good source of simple carbohydrates that are easily digestible. It is also important to eat no later than 30 minutes prior to a workout, and to hydrate well.

                        A study found that people who eat fruits  daily  increase their immunity  and lack of chances of infection with many diseases. <br>
                       One of the characteristics of fruits is that they contain a few calories, This means they are useful in slimming and weight loss programs and reduce body fat percentage.They also contain a high amount of fiber that treats constipation and indigestion. <br> 
                       Other essential nutrients include: Potassium, which prevents blood pressure, reduces the chances of kidney stones. As for vitamin C, most fruits contain a high percentage of it, it is important in the prevention of influenza, and in the construction and repair of damaged body tissues, and has an important role in facilitating the absorption of iron from food, and thus protects against anemia.

                    <p>There are a variety of different fruit juices that a person can drink. These include orange juice, cranberry juice, apple juice, and others. Different fruit juices offer various health benefits, but some risks are also associated with drinking large amounts of certain juices. <br>
                        Fruit juice comes from the flesh of the fruit or from the whole fruit itself. The method of making fruit juice varies depending on the fruit, but many manufacturers make juice by crushing or “pressing” the fruit to squeeze out the juice inside, then pasteurizing or adding preservatives before packaging the final product. <br>
                        Though many fruit juices have health benefits, consuming too much fruit juice can cause health complications for people, such as weight gain or changes to blood sugar levels. <br>
                        This article discusses the different fruit juices available, their health benefits, and certain risks.

                    <p>Protein is essential for muscle growth. Many athletes and gym enthusiasts consume protein shakes because they believe that these drinks will help them bulk up after strength training. <br>
                        A 2018 analysis of 49 studies supports the use of protein supplementation for this purpose. The research suggests that protein supplements significantly improve muscle size and strength in healthy adults who perform resistance exercise training, such as lifting weights. <br>
                        Protein supplementation was equally effective in men and women. However, the effectiveness may decrease with age, as older adults have higher protein requirements than younger people. <br>
                        The researchers also noted that once protein exceeded 1.6 grams (g) per kilogram (kg) of body weight (or 0.73 g per pound (lb) of body weight), the participants did not experience any additional benefits.
